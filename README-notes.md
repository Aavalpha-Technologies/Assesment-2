## Design Decisions
- Used minimal backend structure for clarity
- Separated business logic from API layer

## Trade-offs
- No authentication implemented
- No database used (in-memory logic only)

## Assumptions
- Card type is detected using the first digit
- Default card type is RuPay

## Unfinished / Skipped
- Unit tests not added due to time constraints
